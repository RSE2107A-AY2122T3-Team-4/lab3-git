I am Joshua, I like to try new things. From ice-skating to aerial arts to water sports.

I enjoy programming as it allows me to be creative and create things that are unique.

I used to use many different teaching aids and computer apps created by independent programmers.

In a way one day I hope to give back just like this people.
