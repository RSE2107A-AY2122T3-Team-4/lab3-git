Joshua.

I hope to create something that I am proud of using computers and programming.

My name is Bryan Sentoso, and I hope after going through this course, I would better understand and appreciate robotics and hopefully have the necessary skills required to be a 
better engineer.

My name is Paul Yong Shao En. 
I hope that by going through this course, 
I am able to learn more about the industry standards and practices for 
robotics, so that I can be better prepared to work in a robotics field.

Syamim, from this course i hope to get experience on how robots are made in the industry and gain insight on how to optimise my workflow.
